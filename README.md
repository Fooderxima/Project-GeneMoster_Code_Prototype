# Project-GeneMoster_Code_Prototype
The entire repository is built as a portfolio to show partial of my works that I have accomplished in the educational mobile game project: GeneMonster to the admission committee. In this project, I made the entire game prototype for the company by myself for the purpose of showing the studio we cooperate with our gameplay mode.
